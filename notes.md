## Chapter 1 Agile introduction
- Deliver something of value every week
  1. Break big problems into small ones
  2. Focus on the important stuff
  3. Making sure what you deliver works
  4. Look for feedback
  5. Change course if necessary
  6. Become accountable
- The highest priority is to satisfy the customer.
- Planning:
  - Create user stories
  - Distribute stories into iterations
  - Measure team velocity
  - Being flexible with scope
  - Adaptive planning
- Doing everything necessary to produce shippable code
- P: Working software is the primary measure of success.
- Three simple truths:
  1. It is impossible to gather all the requirements at the beginning of
     a project.
  2. Whatever requirements you do gather are guaranteed to change.
  3. There will always be more to do than time and money will allow.
- There is no one way of agile.
## Chapter 2 Meet you agile team
- Roles blur on agile projects.
- Co-location is the best thing for an agile team.
- Engaged customers is a must.
- P: Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the
  project.
- You must build customer credibility.
- Agile teams need to be able to self-organize.
- An agile team will always want to be accountable for the results they
  produce.
- P: Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and
  support the need, and trust them to get the job done.
- Put the team in front of the customers.
- Cross-functionality. Agile team members should be generalists.
- There are people who know what needs to be built (customers) and people who
  can build it (the development team).
- On-site customer (product owner in Scrum)
- The agile analyst: works closely with the customer to figure out the details
  of how some feature needs to work. Helps write user stories with the
  customer.
- The agile programmer: very serious about quality software, writes lots of
  tests, continuously designing and improving software, makes sure the code
  base is always production-ready.
- The agile testers: insert themselves early in an agile project, work closely
  with user stories and ensure that the software works. Also work closely with
  developers with testing and try to break the application form all possible
  angles.
- The agile project manager: continuously plans, re-plans and adjusts the course
  when necessary. Helps create the environment so the team should function in
  his absence. Gets status reports for stakeholders, forges relationships
  within the company, protects the team from outside forces.
- The agile UX designer: understands the customer's needs and collaborates with
  the team to figure out how best to meet them.
- Forming an agile team:
  - Look for generalists
  - People who are comfortable with ambiguity. Everything is going the change
    constantly. 
  - Team players who can check their egos at the door. People who enjoy
    learning and growing with others.
## Chapter 3 How to get everyone on the Bus
- The assumption of consensus where none exists is what kills most projects
- Right from the start you need to ask though questions:
  - How much experience does your team have?
  - Have you ever done this type of thing?
  - How much money do we have?
  - Who's calling the shots on this project?
  - Were there other projects where you took a junior team and could
    successfully write a highly complex software in an unfamiliar environment
    or programing language.
- Inception deck
  - Involve everyone, including the stakeholders.
  - Can take from a couple of days to about two weeks.
  - In a nutshell:
    - Ask why we are here.
    - Create elevator pitch.
    - Design a product box.
    - Create a NOT list.
    - Meet your neighbors.
    - Show the solution.
    - Ask what keeps us up at night.
    - Size it up.
    - Be clear on what's going to give.
    - Show what it's going to take.
## Chapter 4 Seeing the Big Picture
- Why are we here? See the problem from the customers perspective. Make better
  decisions. Better balancing conflicts and trade offs. Discover the
  commander's intent: expression, phrase or statement that summarizes the goal
  or purpose of you project or mission.
- Create and elevator pitch:
  - For [target customer]
  - Who [statement of need or opportunity]
  - the [product name]
  - is a [product category]
  - that [key benefit, compelling reason to buy]
  - Unlike [primary competitive alternative]
  - our product [statement of primary differentiation].
- How to create a product box:
  - Brainstorm your product's benefits: never tell customers features, instead
    tell the the benefits.
  - Create a slogan. 
  - Design the box.
- Create a NOT list
  - Choose what's in the scope, choose what's out of scope.
  - You can also have an 'unresolved' box. 
  - The team and the customers get together and brainstorm all the high-level
    features they'd like to see in their software.
  - IN: the stuff we want to focus on.
  - OUT: the stuff that we aren't going to sweat.
  - UNRESOLVED: things we still need to make a decision about.
- Meet your neighbors
  - Map out who is in your project community. Start building relationships with
    them.
  -  Get together with the team and brainstorm everyone you think you are going
     to need to interact with before your project can go live.
