  can build it (the development team).
- On-site customer (product owner in Scrum)

  of how some feature needs to work. Helps write user stories with the
  customer.

  tests, continuously designing and imporving software, makes sure the code
  base is always production-ready.

  with user stories and ensure that the software works. Also work closely with
  developers with testing and try to break the application form all possible
  angles.

    learning and growing with others.

- Right from the start you need to ask though questions:
  - How much experience does your team have?
  - Have you ever done this type of thing?
  - How much money do we have?
  - Who's calling the shots on this project?
  - Were there other projects where you took a junior team and could
    successfully write a highly complex software in an unfamiliar environment
    or programing language.
- Iception deck
  - Involve everyone, including the stakeholders.
  - Can take from a couple of days to about two weeks.
  - In a nutshell:
    - Ask why we are here.
    - Create elevator pithc.
    - Design a product box.
    - Create a NOT list.
    - Meet your neighbors.
    - Show the solution.
